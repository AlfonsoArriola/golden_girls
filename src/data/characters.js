Stan and Dorothy eventually moved to Miami, but divorced after 38 years when Stan left her for a young flight attendant. The marriage produced two children, Kate, in her early 20s, and Michael, who was inconsistently aged between his mid-20s and late 30s (Michael was purportedly the cause of the shotgun wedding). In the series\' final episode, Dorothy marries Blanche\'s uncle, Lucas Hollingsworth, and relocates to Atlanta. Arthur also played Dorothy\'s grandmother, Sophia\'s mother, in a flashback episode to when they lived in Brooklyn'
